<p>Use the filesystem as a computing environment. </p>
<p>Make sure you have Extism installed: https://extism.org/docs/install</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">make plugin # requires Rust toolchain
make run # requires Go toolchain
</code></pre>
<p>Demo: invert your images using Extism + your file system (or build your own plug-ins to operate on files, see the plugins directory for implementation)</p>
<ul>
<li>add a new PNG to the opened directory (or navigate to <code>./inverter</code> at repo root)</li>
<li>see new PNG replacing the original with inverted colors</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently not run recursively, but would be cool to assume all new directories with files + .wasm are watched and computed.</p>
<p>This program treats a directory, a written file, and a single .wasm module as the unit of computation. </p>
<p>For each WRITE operation, the .wasm is loaded and passed the file that triggered the WRITE event. It returns a single value, which is then used to overwrite the file which caused the WRITE event to trigger.</p>
